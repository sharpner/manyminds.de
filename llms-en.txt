# Nino Wagensonner - AI Agents Consultant

> I build AI agents that work autonomously. No demos, no slides - systems that run in production.

## About

15 years software architecture for freenet, DIE ZEIT, Brainloop and others. Independent since 2020. Co-founder of projectfit.ai.

## Services

Which processes can AI agents take over? Where's the biggest leverage? Realistic assessment of effort and return.

### Implementation
Building workflows that work autonomously. Integration into existing systems. No dependency on single solutions.

### Team Enablement
Your team learns to work with AI agents. Lasting competence instead of external dependency.

## For Whom

Not for you if "AI strategy" means a nice slide deck.
